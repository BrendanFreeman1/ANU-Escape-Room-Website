# ANU Escape Room Website

<p>My very first webpage project.</p>
<p>Designed to be viewed on a mobile device.</p>
<p>This is a project I worked on to assist my partner who was organising the O-Week Escape room activity for the ANU library. I was given an existing template from a pervious iteration to build upon with the new theme of Treasure Island. Aside from updating the pages text, background and styling, I refactored the JavaScript code to dynamically allocate each puzzle to the user in a truly random order, instead of the pre-defined 'random' sequences it had before, drastically reducing the time needed to update details in the puzzles. I cleaned up the HTML, CSS and JavaScript as well as adding comments so future iterations will be easier to change and build out.</p>
